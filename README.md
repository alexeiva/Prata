# Prata

Prata is an elegant Didone typeface with sharp features and organic teardrops. There is a certain tension in the contrast of its virile serifs and soft refined curves. Its triangular serifs complement and accent the thin strokes, and the high contrast means it will work best in display sizes.

Designed by Ivan Petrov for [Cyreal](1).

Vietnamese support was added by Nhung Nguyen <vns.wonderland@gmail.com> @crystaltype.

Prata is a Unicode typeface family that supports languages that use the Latin script and its variants, and could be expanded to support other scripts.
